        <p class="myIntro">I've worked in email marketing since 2012.  My first entry-level position as a front-end website developer came to a quick end.  The VP of my company at that time was doing all of the email campaigns for our clients and he was tired of it.  You see, email (even to this very day) still uses the kind of HTML coding that we used back in the 1990s to make websites before CSS came to be.</p>

        <p class="myIntro">So, using HTML Tables and inline CSS styles, I have worked through to the present day developing and honing these skills.  My current job is designing and coding email templates for hoteliers worldwide.  Sometimes I do them in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, French.  I have clients in Canada, Singapore, Barcelona, Ireland, the United States and each one requires a lot.</p>

        <p class="myIntro">Below are some examples of various projects I've developed for my hotel clients.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">HayCreek Hotels:<br /> 
                <span class="text-muted">The Exeter Inn</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Exeter Inn is situated in Exeter New Hampshire.  The client wanted a reusable email marketing template with a banner, single-column text area and a CTA button to link out to the promo.  This is styled with all the standard colors and email-safe fonts matching as closely as possible to the property's style guide.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This is a campaign template fully populated with images and copy the client chose.  In their creative direction they said they wanted a 4th of July email that had the look and feel of an old time poster or banner that you might see in the 1930s or even Colonial times.  After searching out a variety of iconography used in old samples I saw, this was the final result.  Except for the banner image at the top and the Red, White &amp; Snooze button mid-way down, all of the text is done live via HTML.</p>

            <p class="lead">As you can see, Hay Creek has all of their property templates pretty close in similarity. This property needed a campaign template for advertising multiple promotions.</p>

            <p class="lead">As I said in my intro above, I do campaign templates in a variety of languages.  This one is done in Russian.  It presents a bit of a challenge when the client is trying to tell you to place a link tag around 'these words here'.  Those words there don't look like words to me and I carefully have to match the letters from my HTML to their copy deck to make sure links and formatting are done just right.</p>

            <p class="lead">Carlton City was one of my favorite clients.  They had their act together.  Their marketing team would send me all the images, copy and style guides.  They knew what they wanted every time and I seldom had to go in to a revision phase with them.  It was Design, Develop, Deploy on most occasions.  This is the last campaign I did with them in December 2015 before they parted ways with my company.  Sometimes they would present challenges in the look and feel that required me to next many tables within tables to achieve the right layout for email.</p>

Sure, we've all seen him on TV shouting and calling people donkeys but under that rough exterior is a hard-working man.  This campaign was to show guests the new lunch menu at the hotel cafe that was designed exclusively by Chef Ramsay.  He redesigned the all of the hotel's menus right down to the room service choices.</p>

            <p class="lead">Occasionally, a client will do their own creative and send us a PSD or flat JPG.  They are images top to bottom including every bit of the text except for what you see in the CAN-SPAM footer at the very bottom and preheader at the very top.  This client wanted a look in their email campaigns that standar email HTML coding and inline CSS just cannot accomplish on their own.  Instead, we slice up the image and put it all back together in tables with a tags that take the reader to various landing pages on the client's website.  We call these types of campaigns &quot;Slice &amp; Dice&quot;</p>

            <p class="lead">I know it's simple to make a button for websites using HTML and CSS.  With email development, that is not the case.  It requires additionally using VML for the Outlook versions that ignore standard CSS styles for email.  Some of our clients have buttons that would take longer to redo each month with next text in Photoshop so we have button templates that we've tested time and again to make sure they're working well.  This template shows you a different look to CTA buttons.</p>
